          <li>You can choose between statically typed and dynamically typed.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Statically typed allows for types of variables are known at compile time.</li>
            <li>It still is possible to use JavaScript’s Dynamic typing.</li>
            <li>You get to choose how aggressive you want your variable declaration to be.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>It has many extra features and types that may be useful in niche situations.</li>
        </li>It can be compiled back into JavaScript because it is a superset of JavaScript.</li>

      <h2>Classes in TypeScript</h2>
      <br>
      In TypeScript, classes were implemented to allow for object-oriented programming, if the programmer so wishes. Object-oriented programming allows for parts of the code to be completed and then combined at the end to make a cohesive product.  TypeScript also allows for inheritance and constructors.
      <br>
      <br>
      This is why TypeScript claims to be scalable and good for large applications. Most people understand how this form of programming is useful for a larger group of programmers and for applications.  JavaScript may be good for smaller applications, but gets messy for larger and more industrial uses.

      <h2>Interfaces</h2>
      <br>
      <div id = "quote">
        “One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.”
        <br>
        -Official TypeScript website
      </div>
      <br>
      Interfaces are useful for roughly defining abstract objects. This may be useful in applications like parameters. Instead of passing multiple parameters, you can pass an interface and not have to deal with many inputs.

      <h2>Modules/Namespaces</h2>
      <br>
      Namespaces are called “internal modules” and modules themselves represent “external modules.” Both of these are useful for encapsulation and modularity. This allows for easier organization and such.
      <br>
      <br>
      Modules are preferred as these contain files or lines of code within their own environments so that they won’t interfere with one another in the global scope.

      <h2>More Variable Types</h2>
      <br>
      There are many new types that are added with TypeScript. These include:
      <br>
      <div id = "left-main">
        <ul>
          <li>Enum</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A collection of named constants</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Symbol</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Immutable, unique, and can act like keys for object properties</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Any</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Key word that means unknown variable that, unlike object, allows for arbitrary methods to be applied</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Never</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Key word that ensures a variable or function does not have or return a value</li>
          </ul>
          <li>And many more!</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This allows for a variety of types that can be used for many specific situations.
